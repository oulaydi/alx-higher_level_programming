This repository contains programs written for the Higher-level programming track at the ALX Software Engineering Program. In these projects, I learnt Python & SQL, and I also made use of concepts learnt.
Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell scripting. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* [0x00. Python - Hello, World](./0x00-python-hello_world)
